````

Usage

… and use it to create KSUIDs

````crystal
k = g.generate
````

Partitioning
------------

This library supports partitioning KSUIDs, the most common use-case is to partition KSUIDs generated by different network nodes to
prevent colissions in a distributed system.

Any `Proc(UInt32)` can be used to partition data.

The following partitioning functions are provided:

    * `Ksuid::Partitioner.no_partitions` — Does not partition data, all KSUIDs are in partition zero.
    * `Ksuid::Partitioner.hostname` — Partitions KSUIDs by the first 4 bytes of the system hostname.
    * `Ksuid::Partitioner.string(String)` — Partitions KSUIDs by the first 4 bytes of the given string.
